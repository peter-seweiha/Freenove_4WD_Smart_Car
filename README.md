# Building Machine Learning applications using Freenove Smart Car Kit
In this repository, I'll be ueing Raspberry pi, python, and the Freenove car kit to explore some machine learning applications.


### Projects 
1. **Face Tracking**: Raspberry pi, Freenove car, opencv  
   *Moving the servo to track any face along the X axis*
